# 3-parallax-website

Here is my 3rd project. I've made this website by using HTML & CSS skills. 
In this project, we made parallax website without backend side.
I learned how to shape website with HTML and CSS codes.



As an engineer, I was familiar with IT world but this step was one of my life changing step. 
I'm beginning to a journey which I'm planning to be a perfect Software Developer.
Let's move on...
